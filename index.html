                <h2>About Me</h2>

                <p>My name is Haozhe Feng, a second years study of Northeastern University.</p>
                <p>I'm DS major student. I come from China, a beautiful country that deserve to travel.</p>
                
                <h2>Coding experience</h2>

                <p> The first Langrage I learn is Java, this is a popular coding langrage that many people using around the world. But one of teacher/friend told me that first langrage should be eazy to understand.</p>
                <p>Then I start to learning Python, I think Python is vary intreast langrage and I learn a lot of it since I start learn with Python. I take DS200,DS2500,DS3000 and DS4200 classes to better learning the python langrage.</p>
                <p>From now, I am proficient in using various databases such as pandas, numpy, matlab,seaborn,and other lib. Also I learn a lot of mechin learning such as test and split, linear regression, correlation, Neural network, shortest path, and lot of machine learning technique.</p>    
                <p>I am a sophomore at Northeastern University, studying data science for two years. I can use Python to process data, make data visualization, and have some basic knowledge of website creation. My current GPA is 3.2 and I get A in data science. I have some machine learning knowledge, such as Regression model, CrossValidationRegression, Linear perceptron, etc.</p>
                <h2>Carrier plan</h2>

                <P> The reason I select Data science as my major because I think the AI is the future of Internet. There are many country require AI technique people to help then coustract the company and creat different website and application</P>
                <p> And I really believe this is the hobby or what I am intreast in future.</p>
